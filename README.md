# COMETFlows

Fork of the official code release for COMETFlows by McDonald, Tan, and Luo.

Intended to bring code in line with lightning API changes, extend functionality, and build a basis for future experimentation with and possible extension of the models.


## Setup

This repo uses `uv` (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage dependencies for reproducibility. Hence I recommend to download `uv`, and potentially set the PyTorch index in `pyproject.toml` to the proper value for your hardware. 

Once this is done use `uv run [script_name.py]` to run the script, `uv` will make sure that the right Python and package versions are used.


## Usage
